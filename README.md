# Peergrine
Peergrine is an instant messaging application designed for seamless, private communication without the need for user account registration. Each time a user accesses the platform, a new, temporary identity is automatically created. Peergrine operates entirely within mainstream web browsers and requires a stable internet connection to ensure smooth real-time communication.
## Key Features

- **Instant Messaging**: Engage in private text-based conversations with selected contacts.
- **File Transfer**: Share files such as images, documents, and more with other users.
- **No Account Registration**: A new identity is created upon each session, eliminating the need for account management.
- **Cross-Device Compatibility**: Works on any major browser without requiring additional software installations.

## Development Background

Peergrine was created to address a simple yet important need: facilitating fast, secure data transfer between unfamiliar or temporary devices without the hassle of software installation. This makes Peergrine ideal for quick, on-the-go communication and file sharing.
